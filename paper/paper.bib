  abstract = {The use of elliptic integrals is required to solve many problems of mechanics and geophysics, even though it is laborious to express them analytically. For calculating elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, new and improved analytical dependencies are provided in terms of elementary functions, the values of which are in good agreement (\textasciitilde 1–2\%) with the results of known exact solutions, coinciding with them for the boundary conditions. As a basic practical example of using the formulas obtained, the nonlinear problem of determining the arc length of a sinusoid (cosinusoid) is solved, making it possible to identify sections with nonlinear and linear length change.},

As in previous calculations, we harness powerful tools from the modern scattering amplitudes program including generalized unitarity, the double copy, and advanced multiloop integration methods, in combination with effective field theory. The classical amplitude involves complete elliptic integrals, and polylogarithms with up to transcendental weight 2. Using the amplitude-action relation, we obtain the radial action directly from the amplitude, and match the known overlapping terms in the post-Newtonian expansion.},

Together with known expressions for the magnetic field due to longitudinal magnetization, the calculation of magnetic fields for cylinders with an arbitrary magnetization direction is possible. The expression for transverse magnetization is validated successfully against the well-known limits of an infinitely long cylinder, the field on the axis of the cylinder and in the far field limit. Comparison with a numerical finite-element method displays good agreement, making the advantage of an analytical method over grid-based methods evident.},

We compare the usefulness of these four calculations, An appendix gives MICROSOFT EXCEL® programs for computing the perimeter.},

We present an exact solution for the magnetic field of an ideal solenoid in an easy to use form. The field is expressed in terms of a single function that can be rapidly computed by means of a compact efficient algorithm, which can be coded as an add-in function to a spreadsheet, making field calculations accessible to introductory students. These expressions are not only accurate but are also as fast as most approximate expressions. We demonstrate their utility by simulating the dropping of a cylindrical magnet through a nonmagnetic conducting tube and comparing the calculation with data obtained from experiments suitable for an undergraduate laboratory.},

Unfortunately, none of Rust's safety claims have been formally proven, and there is good reason to question whether they actually hold. Specifically, Rust employs a strong, ownership-based type system, but then extends the expressive power of this core type system through libraries that internally use unsafe features. In this paper, we give the first formal (and machine-checked) safety proof for a language representing a realistic subset of Rust. Our proof is extensible in the sense that, for each new Rust library that uses unsafe features, we can say what verification condition it must satisfy in order for it to be deemed a safe extension to the language. We have carried out this verification for some of the most important libraries that are used throughout the Rust ecosystem.},
