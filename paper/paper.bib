  abstract = {Elliptic curves are commonly used to outline various geophysical objects, natural and artificial bodies, trajectories of the planets, satellites, elementary particles. Utilizing these curves, many theoretical and applied problems in the field of mechanics, geophysics, and mathematical physics can be solved. However, the dependences for finding the length of individual sections (arcs) of the ellipse that are in demand for engineering practice have not been developed up to the present day. The article deals with analytical dependences for determining the length of the arc and entire ellipse that are obtained on the basis of the representation of incomplete and complete elliptic integrals of the 2nd kind via elementary functions. These dependences coincide with the known exact formulas for the boundary counters of an ellipse, namely, a circle and a horizontal segment of a straight line (thin plate). Graphs of the dependence of the ellipse arc length on the central angle and the ratio of the semiaxes are also given. Comparison of the obtained results of solving the test problem by using the proposed method with the reference values found from numerical calculation using the ‚ÄúMathematic‚Äù software has showed a good agreement (‚â§ 0.5\%).},

  abstract = {The use of elliptic integrals is required to solve many problems of mechanics and geophysics, even though it is laborious to express them analytically. For calculating elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, new and improved analytical dependencies are provided in terms of elementary functions, the values of which are in good agreement (\textasciitilde 1‚Äì2\%) with the results of known exact solutions, coinciding with them for the boundary conditions. As a basic practical example of using the formulas obtained, the nonlinear problem of determining the arc length of a sinusoid (cosinusoid) is solved, making it possible to identify sections with nonlinear and linear length change.},

As in previous calculations, we harness powerful tools from the modern scattering amplitudes program including generalized unitarity, the double copy, and advanced multiloop integration methods, in combination with effective field theory. The classical amplitude involves complete elliptic integrals, and polylogarithms with up to transcendental weight 2. Using the amplitude-action relation, we obtain the radial action directly from the amplitude, and match the known overlapping terms in the post-Newtonian expansion.},

  abstract = {Both wire-wound solenoids and cylindrical magnets can be approximated as ideal azimuthally symmetric solenoids. We present an exact solution for the magnetic field of an ideal solenoid in an easy to use form. The field is expressed in terms of a single function that can be rapidly computed by means of a compact efficient algorithm, which can be coded as an add-in function to a spreadsheet, making field calculations accessible to introductory students. These expressions are not only accurate but are also as fast as most approximate expressions. We demonstrate their utility by simulating the dropping of a cylindrical magnet through a nonmagnetic conducting tube and comparing the calculation with data obtained from experiments suitable for an undergraduate laboratory.},

  abstract = {Rust is a new systems programming language that promises to overcome the seemingly fundamental tradeoff between high-level safety guarantees and low-level control over resource management. Unfortunately, none of Rust's safety claims have been formally proven, and there is good reason to question whether they actually hold. Specifically, Rust employs a strong, ownership-based type system, but then extends the expressive power of this core type system through libraries that internally use unsafe features. In this paper, we give the first formal (and machine-checked) safety proof for a language representing a realistic subset of Rust. Our proof is extensible in the sense that, for each new Rust library that uses unsafe features, we can say what verification condition it must satisfy in order for it to be deemed a safe extension to the language. We have carried out this verification for some of the most important libraries that are used throughout the Rust ecosystem.},
